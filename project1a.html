            <p>Are you looking for the most credible voices in technology news? The rise of online publications and
                blogs
                has resulted in a flood of information regarding computers, mobile gadgets, software and operating
                systems.
                It can be difficult, however, to know which websites you can trust. Here are some of the most
                trusted
                websites; these will help you keep up with the constant flow of technological updates.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>1. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/">Arstechnica.com</a></h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sopa-screenshot-arstechnica-com.png"
                alt="arstechnica">
            <p>
                First on the list is Ars Technica, simply because of the date of inception. This site has been around
                for
                nearly two decades, a very substantial amount of time. The publication, now owned by Conde Nast, is a
                go-to for both tech professionals and hobbyists. Ars Technica features a wide range of news and
                editorials, delving into business, legal ramifications, security, and other consumer interests.
            </p>
            <p>The dialogue isn’t a one-way street, either. Readers can interact with one another by checking out
                the Ars Technica forums, which allow for discussions on hardware modifications, operations systems,
                software and gaming. Ars Technica’s operations are funded primarily by online advertising and it has
                been a paid subscription service since 2001.
            </p>
            <p>Interestingly, the website generated much controversy in 2009 when they prevented users who had installed
                advertisement blocking software from viewing the site. While this stirred some negative reactions, the
                site
                continues to be a trusted resource today.
            </p>

            <h2>2. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/">Techcrunch.com</a></h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-08-at-1.34.42-PM.png"
                alt="techcrunch">
            <p>Second on the list is TechCrunch, thanks to the website’s more than 50,000 active contributors. If you
                want
                to get the scoop on technology startups, then TechCrunch is the news source for you. This publication
                highlights the business side of tech innovation, covering major acquisitions, funding sources, and
                product
                launches. You can browse news based on brand names, such as Google, Apple, or Twitter. You can also sift
                through news and reviews by tuning into different category channels like Enterprise, Startups, or
                Mobile.
            </p>
            <p>One of the most compelling sections of Tech Crunch is Crunch Base, a vast database of technology
                companies
                and startups. Each Crunch Base profile includes financial details for each company, including funding
                received, headquarters locations, and the names of the founders.
            </p>
            <p>In 2011, the company was accused of ethical violations and the founder, Michael Arrington, left the
                company.
                Fortunately, the company was able to bounce back, and still provides great technological updates for
                consumers.

                alt="engadget">
            <p>Engadget makes number three on our list, because it’s a great multilingual resource. Impressively, this
                resource has been helping people make informed tech purchasing decisions since 2004. It’s no surprise
                that
                the collection of blogs on Engadget have had such success, since it was created by a co-founder of
                Gizmodo,
                Peter Rojas.
            </p>
            <p>Interestingly, the editorial team involved in steering Engadget to fame has moved on to pursue several
                other
                successful endeavors. For example, former Engadget editor-in-chief, Joshua Topolsky, went on to create
                The
                Verge, followed by an editorial role at Bloomberg.

                alt="thenextweb">
            <p>The Next Web makes the next spot on our list, because of their more than 6.5 million unique monthly
                visitors.

            </p>
            <p>Unlike many other tech websites, The Next Web has been able to avoid controversy and continues to thrive
                drama-free today.

                alt="wired">
            <p>We love this website because it came from a popular magazine! Coming in at number five on our list, this
                website split from Wired Magazine in 1990, when it was purchased by Conde Nast Publishing.
            </p>
            <p>This publication deals with the popular culture surrounding technology. If you’re looking for an
                engaging,
                yet casual read, this website is for you. Wired features entertainment, opinion, business, and security
                news
                regarding electronics of all kinds. Furthermore, if you’re interested in an old-school paper and ink
                experience, you can still buy a copy of Wired magazine on newsstands.

            <p>Tom’s Hardware makes the next spot on our list of trustworthy websites, because it’s been around since
                1996.
                If you’re looking for a site that can help with projects, then check this one out. Tom’s Hardware
                features a
                unique “build your own” section, where you can learn how to build your own computer.
            </p>
            <p>Anyone who’s replaced a computer part or built a PC will tell you how difficult it is to track reviews,
                part
                upgrades, and the latest sales. Furthermore, seasoned hardware tinkerers are faced with a dizzying array
                of
                components to choose from.
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately, Tom’s Hardware helps you cut through the noise and get sound advice on computer parts, from
                tower cases to motherboards. As stated above, this is the ultimate resource if you’re thinking about
                building a computer, particularly for gaming.

                alt="Cnet">
            <p>Next on the list is CNET, because we like their region-specific and language-specific editions. Early
                consumers loved CNET because of their enormous library of freeware and software reviews, available
                through
                the CNET download section.
            </p>
            <p>This publication has been around since 1994, and owned by The CBS Corporation since 2008. Reviews make up
                the
                majority of content on CNET, helping consumers choose the best hardware, software, and tech services.
            </p>
            <p>Remember Limewire? CNET has been accused of having a part in the controversial music sharing program, but
                a
                lawsuit from 2011 has yet to go anywhere.

            <p>Number eight on the list is 9 to 5 Mac, solely because it was founded only seven short years ago. The
                website
                is very impressive, however, and covers more than just Apple products. They provide information on

                alt="gizmodo">
            <p>Coming in towards the end of our list because it was founded just a little over a decade ago, Gizmodo is
                a
                prime example of how powerful crowd sourced information and blogging can be. This publication is part of
                the
                Gawker Media network, a family of blogs that includes Lifehacker, Deadspin, and Jezebel.
            </p>
            <p>These blogs are all powered by Kinja, which enables any user, including readers, to contribute to the
                discussion with their very own blog posts. This blurs the line between bloggers and readers, encouraging

            <p>Lastly,we have Bits: The Business of Technology from the New York Times. This newspaper is a leading
                resource
                for various information; so it’s no surprise that this long-standing publication has created a blog
                dedicated to technology!

            <p>Bits gathers information from every corner of the Internet, and NY Times writers weigh in on new product
                launches, tech conventions, and upcoming gadget developments. With so many active contributors, and such
                an
                impressive host, it’s no wonder why Bits needed to make our list of the top tech websites.
